     <field name="scopecontent_teim">Volumes 80, 89, 100, 102, 110, and 111 were donated to the Historical Files in 1964 by partner Moreau D. Brown. Volume 80 (Baltimore Directory, 1802) includes annotations by a previous owner, "shopkeeper" Philip Bier. Volume 89 is stamped and signed inside numerous times by James Brown and identified as his ("James Brown's Book...December 10 1803") at age 12. Volume 98, which comprises two editions of the same pamphlet bound together, bears the bookplate of Frederic C. Wagner, "Captain, and Provost Marshal 7th district, NY", and is inscribed by him to "Messrs. Brown Bros." Volume 102 (Memorial address... in remembrance of Mr. James Brown, 1878) is inscribed to "Thatcher M. Brown from his grandmamma E.M. Brown April 1878": Eliza Maria Coe Brown was James Brown's widow and the mother of John Crosby Brown. Volumes 110-112 (Old Merchants of New York) bear the bookplates of printer and typographer Theodore De Vinne ("Aere perennius": "more lasting than bronze"), and would have been dispersed from his collection at auction in 1920. Volumes 113 and 114, which are later issues of Old Merchants of New York, have the bookplate of partner John Crosby Brown; the latter is also inscribed by a Jehiel Clark.</field>
     <field name="scopecontent_teim">Volume 103 (Memorial service at the unveiling of the tablet to the memory of Mr. James Brown..., 1877) was given to the Historical Files by Mrs. John Crosby Brown II. A photocopy is in the James Brown files of Subseries I.C.vi. Partners.

Volume 130 is marked "Thatcher M. Brown III" in Sarah B. Brown's hand. Volume 129 (Will of James Brown, Esq., 1875) is annotated in an unidentified hand with records of dates and amounts of payments to family members and retainers.
