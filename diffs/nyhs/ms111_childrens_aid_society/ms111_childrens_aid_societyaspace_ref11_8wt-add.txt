     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The mission of sending children to the country was the driving force of the Children's Aid Society from its founding in 1853. Twenty-five years later, in the 26th annual report from 1878, the society continued to affirm that "the most important part of our work is the transference of poor and homeless children to good country homes." The primacy of that mission continued throughout the period covered by this collection. The Emigration Department sent thousands of children to foster care and(for older children)employment situations in the country. In some cases, children were formally adopted by families, or families later chose to adopt them, but in most cases children were placed less formally.</field>
     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The CAS called the program Emigration in its annual reports beginning circa 1859, and it was known as the Emigration and/or Placing-Out Department until 1899. From 1899-1925 it was known in the annual reports as the "Western Emigration and Placing-Out Department," although the CAS continued to use forms which called it alternately the Emigration or Placing-Out Department.</field>
     <field name="scopecontent_teim">It is well known that the CAS separated children from their families to start anew. It is less widely known that the CAS also provided train tickets for entire families to leave the city together, to rejoin a breadwinner or pursue other opportunities. Beginning in 1874, the CAS initiated an explicit "family emigration" program which signalled a shift toward a goal of keeping families together. Beginning around 1898 the department's stated purpose in the annual reports included not only "finding homes for homeless chldren" but also "assisting poor families to reach distant friends for employment." Families traveled on the same trains as companies of children and are included in the "Company Books" and the "Record Books" in subseries XI.4. However, families were never included in the case files of the Emigration Department; the CAS did not provide additional social work care for them or track their progress. Although some information about families is contained in Emigration Department Record Books, other records of Family Emigration were kept separate, in volumes that are arranged in the following series of this collection, as Series XII.2.</field>
