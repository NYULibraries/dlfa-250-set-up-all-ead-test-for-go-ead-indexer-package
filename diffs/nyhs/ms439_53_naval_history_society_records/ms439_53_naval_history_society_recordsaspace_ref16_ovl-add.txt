     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes records of the founding and administration of the Society, its various locations, and officers. The President's reports (1928-1935, by Col. James Barnes) provide details of manuscript acquisitions and provenance, and the Society's publications for each year. The Secretary's reports (1926-1929, 1931-1935) focus on membership news: new members gained and those lost through death or resignation. The Treasurer's reports (1925-1936 by Robert Neeser) include information on the Naval History Fund, which was used to purchase additional library and manuscript materials.</field>

This edition includes a complete history of the Society to date: founders, minutes of annual meeting, resolutions, details on the collections and publications, and information on memorial activities in 1924 honoring Rear Admiral Thayer Mahan.</field>
