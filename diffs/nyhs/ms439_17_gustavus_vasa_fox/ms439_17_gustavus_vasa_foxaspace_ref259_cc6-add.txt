     <field name="unittitle_teim">Series VI. Printed materials and clippings (1850-1883)</field>
     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes publications and other printed information as well as newspaper clippings on the Woodbury family, and on Fox's areas of interest and related to his writings. Some of the commercial printed materials appear to have been collected randomly. The scrapbook pages are leaves from other books onto which clippings have been glued. The document on "small Vessels in which I have been concerned" is anonymous but appears to be written by Robert Bennett Forbes, based on the ships listed. One document is in Chinese and may be the guest list for an event Fox attended.</field>

     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The materials are arranged chronologically. The bundled clippings were originally stored separately; some of the other subject-related clippings were originally in other series and have been gathered together here. Some of the clippings were grouped by subject and others by time period; their original arrangement has been retained.</field>
