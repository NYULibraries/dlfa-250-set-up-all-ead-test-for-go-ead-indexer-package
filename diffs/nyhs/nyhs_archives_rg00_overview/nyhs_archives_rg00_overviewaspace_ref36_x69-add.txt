     <field name="unittitle_teim">NYHS-RG 11. Manuscripts of lectures and addresses (1809-1957, 2001, 2015-2016)
 </field>
     <field name="scopecontent_teim">This record group principally includes a manuscript form of about 150 addresses presented at N-YHS. The bulk of these are papers read or other prepared remarks made at N-YHS from the 1840s through the 1930s. Most typically, the manuscripts are from historians and other individuals of some renown, with few from figures of national prominence. Most of the addresses concern some aspect of early New York history, particular NYHS accomplishments, or broader reflections on the study and lessons of history and on America.</field>
