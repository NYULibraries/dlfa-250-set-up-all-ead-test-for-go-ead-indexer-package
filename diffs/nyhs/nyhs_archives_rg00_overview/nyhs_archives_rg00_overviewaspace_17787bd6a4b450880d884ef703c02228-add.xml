     <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although the record group does not hold comprehensive records concerning N-YHS's financial history, there are several 19th century records (cash ledgers, mortgagee holdings documentation, bank books, etc.) that provide glimpses into N-YHS's early finances. Also there is extensive financial data (expenses, budgets, investments, etc.) for the late 1980s and early 1990s; though the timeframe is limited, it represents a period when N-YHS faced a severe fiscal crisis and so can provide insight into that pivotal moment in the organization's history. The record group also holds much information about many of N-YHS's special funds (e.g., Harper Fund) and the financial aspects of the Encyclopedia of New York City project.</field>
