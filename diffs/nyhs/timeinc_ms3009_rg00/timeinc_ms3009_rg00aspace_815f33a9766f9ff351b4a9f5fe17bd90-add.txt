Annex Files is an assembled collection created by the Time Inc. archives of materials considered too bulky or infrequently requested to be housed in the main archives. Records in the Annex Files seem to be an extension of the of the materials in the Time Inc. Subject Files (MS 3009-RG 1) and document the history of Time Inc. as an organization with information on each publication and many departments at Time Inc. The collection is largely made up of records pertaining to the development of magazines, The March of Time, Home Box Office (HBO), Time-Life Books, and information on public affairs programs and events, international business, and advertising studies and surveys.</field>
     <field name="scopecontent_teim">Additional records on the divisions, departments and offices at Time Inc. are also in the Time Inc. Reference Files (MS 3009-RG 3).</field>
