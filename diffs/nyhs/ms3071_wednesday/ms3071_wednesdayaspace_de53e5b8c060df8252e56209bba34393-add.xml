-        Dear Mrs. Moffat -- Thankyou for your friendly invitation. I'm afraid I couldn't manage January 6th, as I rather expect to be out of town at that time.

My fee is One Hundred and Fifty dollars and if you say that is too much I shall be the first to agree! Cordially yours, Christopher Morley
