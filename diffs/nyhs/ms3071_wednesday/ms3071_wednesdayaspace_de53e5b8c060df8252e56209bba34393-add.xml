<         Dear Mrs. Moffat -- Thankyou for your friendly invitation. I'm afraid I couldn't manage January 6th, as I rather expect to be out of town at that time. Possibly, if your club really wants me, we could arrange some afternoon later in that month; but I must frankly say that my terms are rather steep. There are many very friendly invitations of this sort, and one has, in self-defence, to put them on a rather brutal basis. My fee is One Hundred and Fifty dollars and if you say that is too much I shall be the first to agree! Cordially yours, Christopher Morley
