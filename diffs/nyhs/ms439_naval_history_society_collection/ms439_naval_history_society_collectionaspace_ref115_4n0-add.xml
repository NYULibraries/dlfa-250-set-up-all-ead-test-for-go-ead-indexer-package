     <field name="scopecontent_teim">British troops under the command of Sir Henry Clinton mounted attacks on Fort Sullivan (close to the later site of Fort Sumter) in Charleston harbor by both land and sea in June, 1776, believing its defenses to be incomplete. Britain's plan had been to subdue rebel forces in the southern colonies and muster more support from Tories after their previous defeat at Bunker Hill and continued challenges in the northern colonies. The attacks on Fort Sullivan were repulsed, however, culminating in the withdrawal of British troops and Clinton's return to New York City. The British did not launch subsequent assaults in the south until 1778, returning to Charleston only in May, 1780.</field>
