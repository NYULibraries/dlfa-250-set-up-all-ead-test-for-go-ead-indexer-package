     <field name="scopecontent_teim">Lewis Randolph Hamersly (1847-1910) served in the Navy from 1862 to 1866 and in the Marine Corps from 1866 to 1869 before entering the publishing trade. His "Records of living officers," published by J.B. Lippincott and others in seven editions from 1870 to 1902, detailed the full records of living officers in the US Navy and Marine Corps. After establishing his own publishing firm, he published later editions of this and other reference works including "A naval encyclopedia" in 1881, "List of officers of the Navy of the United States and of the Marine Corps from 1775 to 1900" in 1901, and "First citizens of the republic" in 1906.</field>
