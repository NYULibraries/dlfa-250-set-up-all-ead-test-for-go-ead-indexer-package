     <field name="scopecontent_teim">Originally commissioned in 1856, by 1862 Wabash was a permanent part of the Charleston blockade, operating out of Port Royal. That year, a landing party from it occupied St. Augustine, Florida; another manned a battery that bombarded Fort Pulaski, Georgia, forcing its surrender. Its howitzers supported land troops at the Battle of Pocotaglio, South Carolina, on October 22, 1862.  Wabash later joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and saw duty in Spain and the Mediterranean after the Civil War before being decommissioned in 1912. The materials in this collection have been digitized and are available online to on-site researchers and to users affiliated with subscribing institutions via EBSCOhost.</field>
