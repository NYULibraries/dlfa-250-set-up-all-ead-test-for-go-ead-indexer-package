     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series consists of four volumes of official outgoing letters and orders of Admiral George B. Rodney while commander-in-chief of British vessels in the West Indies during the American War of Independence and during his visit to New York City (October-November 1780). Volume 3 includes an index. Volume 1 was kept by Admiral Rodney aboard RMS Sandwich and RMS Princess Royal, mostly while in the West Indies, but it also includes some New York orders. The volumes provide details of the administration and outfitting of ships at war, discipline, weather, and personalities.</field>

     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The overwhelming majority of materials in the Naval History Society Collection pertain to American naval and maritime ships, personalities, and events. Because of Rodney's role as Admiral of British forces in the West Indies during the Revolution, however, his materials were of profound interest to the Society. These volumes were purchased with monies in the Naval History Society Fund, administered by the New-York Historical Society after it subsumed the Naval History Society in 1925, and added to the Naval History Society's collections.</field>
