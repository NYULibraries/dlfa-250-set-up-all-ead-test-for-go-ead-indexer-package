     <field name="unittitle_teim">Series 41. US Frigate Savannah (1819-1820)</field>
     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series consists of the record book of Nicholas Vincent, documenting the time spent by workmen who built the brig Benefactor for the Burrit and Cannon company at Norwalk, Connecticut, in 1810; and the dimensions of the US Frigate Savannah, construction of which began in 1820. The first 14 pages appear to have been used as a scrapbook into which were pasted cartoons, newspaper clippings, and mock foreign currency. The additions have been torn away in some places, revealing handwritten entries underneath. There are also lists of spars used for construction of Enterprize and Spinks, and dimensions for sloop Curazo.</field>
