     <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Brandywine, which had transported the Marquis de Lafayette back to France in 1825 after his triumphal tour of the United States, left New York City on September 3, 1826, as the flagship of Commodore Jacob Jones and carrying a relief crew for  Dolphin. Its tour of duty in the Pacific included protecting American citizens, especially merchant seamen being impressed into service by the Peruvian navy. Until August 1826,  Dolphin had cruised the Pacific coast of South America searching for mutineers of the whaler  Globe, returning to Callao with the two surviving members.</field>
