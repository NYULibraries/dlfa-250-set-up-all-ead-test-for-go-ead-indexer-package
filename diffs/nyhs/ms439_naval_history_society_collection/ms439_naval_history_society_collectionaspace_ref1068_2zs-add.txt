     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Rhode Island cities on Narragansett Bay, including Providence and Newport, have a long history of the building and outfitting of naval and commercial shipping. The District of Bristol was established in 1801 and included the towns of Bristol, Warren, and Barrington. Bristol was the sole point of entry for the district and the collector resided there. In 1822 the district's name was changed to the District of Bristol and Warren, which remained unchanged until 1913, when one district was established for the entire state and the Bristol-Warren designation was abolished.</field>
