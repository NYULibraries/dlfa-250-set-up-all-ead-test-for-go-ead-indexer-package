     <field name="unittitle_teim">Series 42. Sarah Smith Stafford (1877-1895)</field>
     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series consists of one volume, privately printed by Press of E.B. Stillings &amp; Co., Boston, documenting the history of the flag that purportedly flew over John Paul Jones's (see Series 28) ship Bon Homme Richard. Bound into it are letters dated 1877 from the flag's owner Sarah Smith Stafford to John Sanford Barnes (see Series 3), detailing its history and her family's connection to the flag, a newspaper clipping from the Chicago  Tribune, and a photograph of the flag. The clipping is from the papers of Richard Worsam Meade 3rd (see Series 31) in the library of his son, Richard Worsam Meade 4th, and was presented to the Naval History Society by his widow on May 3, 1934.</field>

     <field name="scopecontent_teim">Part of the romance and power of John Paul Jones's role in revolutionary history is the probably apocryphal story of his having flown the first American flag over his vessel Bon Homme Richard. From that ship, according to often-repeated stories, the flag fell into the ocean, was rescued by young Lt. James Stafford, and given to him by Jones in thanks for his bravery. His daughter, Sarah Smith Stafford became the flag's owner and then willed it to her brother Samuel Bayard Stafford. It was eventually donated to the Smithsonian Institution, which exhibited it until the 1930s when it was determined not to be authentic and removed from view.</field>
