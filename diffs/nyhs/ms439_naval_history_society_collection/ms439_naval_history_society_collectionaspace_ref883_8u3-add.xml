     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence documents organizations and individuals interested in Jones material, including the Library of Congress (the Manuscripts Division published "A calendar of John Paul Jones manuscripts in the Library of Congress" in 1903); biographer Anna deKoven (author of the 1913 "The letters of John Paul Jones"); and Grenville Kane, the Naval History Society's treasurer who was acknowledged as the greatest collector of Jones material. There is both a clean and an edited version of the typed transcript of Jones's correspondence, which Col. James Barnes may have planned to publish.</field>
     <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some of the photocopied material shows penciled notes on the original items' provenance and history. The Beaumont Groube material documents John Sanford Barnes's effort to determine, through a handwriting comparison, the writer of  Serapis's logbook (see Series 49). Photocopies of Jones's sealing wax imprint on the DeNeufville letter fueled continuing speculation about whether the seal itself had originally been a gift to him from Marie Antoinette.</field>

     <field name="scopecontent_teim">John Paul Jones is among the most romantic and written-about figures in Revolutionary history. His raising of the first American flag aboard a naval vessel in 1776, his response to the British call to surrender  Bon Homme Richard of "I have not yet begun to fight," and his victory aboard that vessel over  Serapis in 1779 are elements of American nation-building with almost mythic significance. John Sanford Barnes's Jones collection was a product of his general interest in naval history (with a focus on heroic exploits) magnified by his often-mentioned family connection with Jones's contemporaries Commodore Bainbridge (see Series 1) and Admiral Barry (see Series 5): Barnes's wife's grandfather James Hayes was a nephew of and adopted by John Barry; his wife's mother was Bainbridge's daughter, Sarah Bainbridge Hayes.</field>
     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The early 20th century saw the publication of many biographies and articles about Jones's personal life and exploits. Their prevalence is perhaps attributable to the general increased focus on naval contributions to military victories after the Spanish American War in 1898 and efforts to build a "new American navy" for the new century. In 1900 August Buell published the widely quoted and later disparaged "Paul Jones: Founder of the American Navy"; in 1905 James Barnes's own "The personal appearance of John Paul Jones" was published in Appleton's Booklover's Magazine. The Naval History Society's first publication was "Logs of the  Serapis,  Alliance, and  Ariel under the Command of John Paul Jones, 1778-1780," edited by John Sanford Barnes, and printed by De Vinne Press, New York, in 1911, based on the original and transcribed logbooks (see Series 49) in his personal collection. Anna deKoven's biography (for which she consulted Barnes and his collection) was published in 1913, and in 1917 Don Seitz published "Paul Jones: His exploits in English seas during 1778 to 1780." Each added new information and raised further questions about details of Jones's life and genealogy, accomplishments, death, and burial, which were discussed both privately in correspondence among authors and collectors, and publicly in newspaper letters columns. </field>
