     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The son of General James Barnes (see Series 2), John S. Barnes was born at West Point, NY, in 1836. He entered the Naval Academy at Annapolis at age 14, serving after his graduation on Preble, and under Commodore Stewart on San Jacinto in Europe and the West Indies, and on Saratoga. He was aboard Arctic when it participated in the first survey for the original Atlantic cable in 1856. The following year, aged 21, he was appointed assistant professor of ethics at the Naval Academy, and after a subsequent year in private business he was appointed master of Jamestown. In 1858 he resigned his commission and attended law school in Albany, New York, practicing until 1861. During the Civil War, he served initially as navigator of Wabash, and later as commander of Dawn, Paul Jones, Lenape, and Bat. In 1863 he married Susan Bainbridge Hayes, granddaughter of Commodore William Bainbridge (see Series 1) and great-grandniece of Admiral John Barry (see Series 5). After the War, he served as commander of the Naval Academy's practice ships Marblehead and Savannah, as an instructor at the Academy, and wrote "Submarine Warfare": the first major work on the use of torpedoes.</field>
