Johnson, he taught infantry tactics there and then served in the military garrison in Charleston Harbor. At the outbreak of the Civil War he raised the 18th Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers and was appointed Colonel, later serving at the battles of Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, where he commanded a division and was wounded.
