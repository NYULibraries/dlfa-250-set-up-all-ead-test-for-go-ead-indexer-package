     <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries consists of eight folders of documents followed by one volume, containing various records retained by the OAS/Graham Home.  Materials include a letter to the Orphan Asylum (1892) requesting a baby girl by mail and a thank you note from the Director of the Menagerie of the Department of Public Parks thanking the boys of the Orphan Asylum for donating a screech owl.  Both of these letters had been framed and displayed by the agency; they have now been removed from their frames for the purpose of conservation.  Other materials in the subseries include a Board of Trustees manual, informational documents about the OAS, and employee records.</field>
