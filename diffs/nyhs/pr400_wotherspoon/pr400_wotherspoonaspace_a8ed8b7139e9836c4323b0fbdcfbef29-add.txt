-        "Paul Liebenow, with his head swathed in bandages and his hands badly burned, said he had tried in vain to pull down life preservers at the time of the disaster. He knew that others had implored the captain to beach the 'Slocum' at the sunken meadows. He heard of the fire when he was between Ninetieth and Ninety-second streets. Among those killed were two of his children, a sister, a sister-in-law, a niece and a nephew."
