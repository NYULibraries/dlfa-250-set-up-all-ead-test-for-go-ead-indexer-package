     <field name="bioghist_teim">Although never owner of Sylvester Manor, Ezra L'Hommedieu (1734 - 1811) was a person of considerable prominence in the history of Long Island and New York State. L'Hommedieu was educated at Yale College and graduated in 1754, after which he began his legal practice in Southold, Long Island. The L'Hommedieu family was forced to relocate to Middletown, CT during the occupation of Long Island by British forces during the American Revolution, and again during the blockade in the War of 1812. L'Hommedieu was married twice, first to Charity Floyd in 1765, and after Charity Floyd's death in 1785, to Mary Catherine Havens in 1803. Ezra and Mary Catherine had one daughter, Mary Catherine L'Hommedieu. Ezra L'Hommedieu was a Patriot, and began public service in 1775 with his election to the Provincial Congress. L'Hommedieu's list of national, state and local political positions is extensive: delegate to the Provincial Congress 1775-1777; member of the New York State Assembly 1777-1783; member of the Continental Congress from 1779-1783 and 1788; member of the New York State Senate from 1784-1792 and again from 1794-1809; member of the state constitutional convention in 1801; Suffolk County Clerk from 1784 to March 1810 and from March 1811 until his death; and Regent of the University of the State of New York 1787-1811. L'Hommedieu was also granted land patents to extensive holdings in the area of the Twenty Townships, a large tract of land purchased from the Oneida Native Americans in 1788 in what is now Central New York.  L'Hommedieu also held lands near Plattsburg, NY and Sandwich, MA, the latter stemming from the Bourn family's property. These items document the surveying, sale and leasing of these lands.</field>
