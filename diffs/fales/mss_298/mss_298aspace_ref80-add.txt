-    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries originally comprised one binder per artist. This original arrangement has been preserved while the visual materials were transferred to new, archivally sound sleeves and rehoused in acid-free binders.The original binder labels have been reproduced here, except for what appears between brackets ("[ ]"), such information was provided by the archivist for ease of use.Some transparencies were originally sleeved in mylar, labeled, and placed in one of eight numbered pockets in a single mylar sleeve. For preservation reasons, the original sleeve was discarded. The transparencies are placed in archivally sound plastic sleeves, and a note is included that reproduces the original numbering, usually in the form, "From Binder Sleeve Pocket Numbered 'x.'"Many of the original sleeves in the binders contained several [elements]. Each [element] has been separated out, placed in its own sleeve, and placed in a new binder following a cover sheet giving the original binder sleeve's order (e.g., Binder Sleeve 2/7), the series and subseries, and the name of the artist as it appeared on the original binder.When an original sleeve or binder pocket contained a large majority of paper-based [elements], everything in that sleeve or pocket was removed and placed in a folder that can be found in ["Subseries D: Material Separated"]. If the original sleeve or pocket contained a large amount of photographic material as well as paper-based material, then the paper material is removed to a folder labelled with the binder's name followed by the phrase "From Binder Sleeve x/y," and the photographic material is resleeved and arranged as described above.In some cases, a binder sleeve with four pockets will contain four or more 3"x5" transparencies in plastic sleeves with a card or sticker taped to the sleeve giving the piece's name and dimensions. Each individually sleeved transparency is taken out of its sleeve and placed in an archival three-pocket mylar sleeve. The original plastic sleeve, if it has bears notations, is placed in the same sleeve as the transparency, along with the card or sticker that bears infomation on the artwork pictured.</field>
