     <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries is arranged in its original order. The index cards were originally contained in file drawers labeled "Works Sold" followed by an alphabetical range. This naming convention has been replicated here (e.g., the cards under the heading "Works Sold A-F" were originally held together in one file drawer labeled "Works Sold A-F"). The ranges of artists contained in each box has been provided by the archivist in the space below the box number.</field>
