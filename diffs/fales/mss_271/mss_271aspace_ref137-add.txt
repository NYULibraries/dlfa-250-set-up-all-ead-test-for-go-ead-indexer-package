     <field name="scopecontent_teim">Issue four of this Washington, D.C.-based mini-zine focuses primarily on personal writings. Beginning with a piece describing the feeling inspired by live female performance in music, the zine continues with a musing about the freeform nature of riot grrrl: the lack of codification, leadership, or a specific agenda or set of goals. Later entries include a memoir concerning domestic violence in the family, sketches, and a "fashion doctrine corollary" that considers personal appearance in light of social and personal struggle. Following are first-person writings on empathy, the desire to share strength with women who have been sexually objectified by men, critiques of religion in the context of domestic violence, and the insecurity of adolescence. Personal top ten lists also appear throughout. </field>
