     <field name="bioghist_teim">Born in London, Charles Sherborn (1831-1912) began work as a goldsmith, chiefly engraving jewelry, but after problems with his business in 1872, Sherborn turned to etching and engraving reproductions of other artist's works. Sherborn began engraving bookplates late in his career, and between the early 1880's and 1912 the artist produced over 350 bookplates, the bulk of his work in the armorial style.</field>
